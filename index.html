    <h2 class="heading">CSS can be added to HTML Document in 3 ways</h2>
    <ul>
        <li class="ul"> Inline - By using the style attribute inside HTML elements.</li><br>
        <li class="ul"> Internal - By using the style attribute in the head section.</li><br>
        <li class="ul">External - By using a link element to link an External CSS file.</li><br>
        <li class="ul">The most common way to add Css, is to keep the style in external css files. However,<span class="text3">in this tutorial we will use inline and Internal style,</span>Because this is easier to demostrate,and easier for you to try it yourself</li>

    <p class="pera">When comparing css class vs ID,the difference is that CSS Class applies a style to multiple elements.ID,applies the style to one unique element.ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an  element and it's used by javascript.</p>
    <p class="pera">In CSS, selectors are used to target a special element or range of element on a webpage.Once an element has been targeted,a style or set of styles can be applied to the element. </p>
    <p class="pera">There is wide range of selectors available,Two of the most commonly use are Class and ID,Both are used target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
